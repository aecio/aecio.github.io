# About Me

Hey! I’m Aécio.

##### Professional Experience
I work as a Research Engineer at [New York University (NYU)](http://engineering.nyu.edu/) in New York City. At NYU, I've been working on multiple research and development projects (including DARPA's Memex and D3M programs) which require a good combination of knowledge and skills in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Information Retrieval (Web Search).
Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer for a Brazilian start-up called [Zunnit Technologies](http://www.zunnit.com/), where we built a scalable news recommendation platform used by the major Brazilian media companies.

##### Education
I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. Previously, I received a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)](http://dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/), and a *B. Tech.* in Analysis and Development of Systems from [Federal Institute of Piauí (IFPI)](http://ifpi.edu.br/).

##### Research Experience
I've had the opportunity to work in several research projects which resulted in various <a href="{{ site.base_url }}/publications">publications</a> in top-tier research venues such as *The Web Conference*, *SIGIR*, *WSDM*, *SPIRE*, and *Information Retrieval Journal*. I'm interested in solving complex problems that usually involve data-driven solutions and lie in the intersection of research areas such as *Information Retrieval*, *Machine Learning*, *Visual Analytics*, and *Information Visualization*.
