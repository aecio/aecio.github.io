# About Me

Hey! I’m Aécio. I currently work as a Research Engineer at
[New York University – Tandon School of Engineering](http://engineering.nyu.edu/)
in New York City. Before moving here, I used to work as Software Engineer for a
Brazilian start-up called [Zunnit Technologies](http://www.zunnit.com/),
building a distributed platform for recommender systems and machine learning.
Before that, I received a masters degree in Computer Science from the
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) under supervision of professor Nivio Ziviani.
At UFMG, I was a colaborator of the **LA**boratory for **T**reating
**IN**formation (LATIN), where I worked in a project called *InWeb*, that aimed to
research and develop new technologies for the Web.

The research topics I’m currently interested are:

- Web Information Retrieval
- Machine Learning
- Data Mining
- Recommender Systems
